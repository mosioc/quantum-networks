# Quantum Communication Simulation

This repository contains a simulation project for quantum communication networks using [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) and [QuISP](https://github.com/sfc-aqua/quisp). The project aims to model and analyze quantum communication protocols and their performance in various network scenarios.

## Overview

- **OMNeT++**: A modular, extensible, discrete-event simulation framework used for network simulations.
- **QuISP**: A quantum network simulator integrated with OMNeT++ to simulate quantum communication protocols, including quantum key distribution and entanglement-based networks.

This project is in active development, with planned updates to enhance simulation capabilities, probably test quantum protocols, and improve performance metrics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/download/) 
- Install [QuISP](https://github.com/sfc-aqua/quisp) by following the official installation guide. (Notice: use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sfc-aqua/quisp.git` to download 5 submodules) 
- Ensure a C++ compiler are installed.


## Future Updates
This repository will be updated in the near future.
- Testing quantum communication protocols.
- Enhanced visualization tools for quantum states and entanglement.
- Performance optimizations for large-scale network simulations.
- Additional documentation and example scenarios.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please submit issues or pull requests for bug fixes, new features, or documentation improvements.
